Trying to set up my Mac for [Day 1 of the hacking with swift challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/1)

-   Updating node to document this process
-   Updating xcode-command line tools `sudo xcode-select --install`
-   Making space for the huge coding softwares
-   Installing xcode (seems to be just stuck in app store)
-   Cleaning up mac - https://github.com/mac-cleanup/mac-cleanup-py

Makes me want to just buy a new decked out mac itself.

-   `brew install gh` github cli

## Cool things learnt

### VS Code Shortcuts

-   To focus on the terminal: `Ctrl + `` (backtick)
-   To focus back on the code editor: `Cmd + 1`
